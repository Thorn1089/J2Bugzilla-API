It allows consumers to compile against a standard API and bind to a specific implementation by providing an appropriate JAR on the classpath at runtime. j2bugzilla-api uses the _Service Provider Interface_ to dynamically load an implementation which fulfills the API specification.\r\n\r\nTo use the API in your code, you must first obtain a reference to the Bugzilla object. This is available through a static factory method in the class which performs the dynamic service lookup, like so:\r\n\r\n`Bugzilla bugzilla = Bugzilla.newBugzilla();`\r\n\r\nUsers may then connect to an installation by providing the URL, as well as optional credentials for HTTP Basic authentication. At this point, bugs can be queried, created, or updated by using one of the repository interfaces. Additionally, metadata about the installation can be retrieved from the Bugzilla object itself, such as the software version, legal field values, and available products. User authentication is also performed via the Bugzilla object.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
